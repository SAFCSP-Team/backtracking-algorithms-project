### Implementation
- Initializes an array `letters` with three elements: "A", "B", and "C". 
- Write a method called `arrangeLetters` that takes the `letters` as input and uses backtracking algorithms to arrange the letters and print all possible arrangements.
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      /* add your code here */
    }

    /* Write the `arrangeletters` method */

}
```
